# CSCI2730-Project
## Deploy the smart contract on Ethereum blockchain
1. `npm install`: install all npm packages.
2. Install Ganache and check the port number must be 7545.
3. `node compile.js`: compile the smart contract.
4. `node index.js`: check if everything runs smoothly up to this step.
5. `node deploy.js`: deploy the smart contract.

 ## TODO:
- Install MongoDB
- Create the front-end with HTML&CSS&JavaScript or ReactJs
  + Registration page
  + Log in page
  + The three confirmation pages
- Refer to UML document (the docx that I mentioned)
  + Refer to interact.js, call the functions in the smart contract to perform the business logic
  + Refer to the API, call the function to fetch the data from MongoDB
  + This means that you just have to follow the UML document and then finish up the interaction (click the button --> perform some functions (that I've done for you) --> redirect to another page)
